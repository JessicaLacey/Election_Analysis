## Election Audit Summary
With a few additions or changes, this script can easily be adjusted for any election. One example of how it could be used is to see the number of votes for a specific candidate within each county. Depending on the data you have, another example of how it could be used in a different election is to see how many ballots were mailed in vs in person for each candidate.
